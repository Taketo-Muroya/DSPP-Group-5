The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.  The 3-year data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 20,000 or more.  Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.","2014-10-06"

"382","Economic Annual Surveys: Business Patterns: Zipcode Business Patterns","zbp",2017,"https://api.census.gov/data/2017/zbp",NA,"unidentified","ZIP Code Business Patterns Methodology: Basis of Reporting ZIP Code Business Patterns is tabulated at the establishment level. An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted or services or industrial operations are performed. It is not necessarily identical with a company or enterprise, which may consist of one or more establishments. When two or more activities are carried on at a single location under a single ownership, all activities generally are grouped together as a single establishment. The entire establishment is classified on the basis of its major activity and all data are included in that classification. Establishment-size designations are determined by paid employment in the mid-March pay period. The size group ""1 to 4"" includes establishments that did not report any paid employees in the mid-March pay period but paid wages to at least one employee at some time during the year. Establishment counts represent the number of locations with paid employees any time during the year. Sources of the Data Payroll and employment data are tabulated from administrative records for single-unit firms and a combination of administrative records and survey-collected data for multi-unit firms. Read more >> Geographic Area Coding Most geography codes are derived from the physical location address reported in Census Bureau programs. The Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Labor Statistics provide supplemental address information. Reliability of Data The data are not subject to sampling error, but are subject to nonsampling errors, which can be attributed to several sources: inability to identify all cases that should be in the universe; definition and classification difficulties; errors in recording or coding the data obtained; and other errors of coverage, processing, and estimation for missing or misreported data. Read more >> Dollar Values All dollar values presented in the reports from the ZIP Code Business Patterns are expressed in current dollars, i.e, 2009 data are expressed in 2009 dollars and 2008 data in 2008 dollars. Consequently, when making comparisons to prior years, data users should take into consideration the inflation that has occurred. All dollar values, unless noted otherwise, are shown in thousands of dollars. Disclosure In accordance with federal law (U.S. Code, Title 13, Section 9) no data are published that would disclose the operations of an individual establishment or business. Noise Infusion: ZIP Code Business Patterns apply the Noise Infusion method of data protection. Noise infusion is a method used to protect data in which values for each establishment such as first-quarter payroll, annual payroll, and number of employees are perturbed prior to publication by applying a random noise multiplier to the data for each company. This method results in a relatively small change to the vast majority of cell values. Read more >> The number of establishments in a particular tabulation cell is not considered a disclosure; therefore, this information may be released without the addition of protective noise. Other Survey-Specific Information Definitional and coverage differences may affect the direct comparison of Economic Census and ZIP Code Business Patterns data. Read more >>","2019-12-05 14:23:04.0"
